This repo provides a simple test to query the OpenCL API for information. 
The query function is built into a shared library.
 This library is then linked against a C++ executable.
 In addition, pybind11 is used to allow the library to be loaded at runtime by a Python script.
 Once loaded, the function can then be called from Python. Both the C++ executable and the Python script link against the same shared object file.
